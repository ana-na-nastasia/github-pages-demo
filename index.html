                <h2>Anastasia Krukovich</h2>
                <h3>TV-presenter x Supervisor at TVBET</h3>
                <p>For the last two years, I have been working as a TV Presenter in a company that specializes on world-known lotteries and card games. Not long ago, in December of 2022, I was promoted to the position of Supervisor, which was an important step in my development not only professional, but also personal. The main supervisor tasks include the ability to organize the working time of the employees, to give the support if it's necessary, to control the quality of the transmissions, as well as to manage any difficulties in the working processes, to keep reports and documentation and to keep in touch with different departments, such as the department of presenters, operators, technicians and management.</p>
                <p class="about-courses">I'm truly in love with my job, but besides it I have an equally important passion: I admire web development and would like to be a frontend developer in the future. Why frontend? I like to create, look for patterns, optimize and improve the results, and I enjoy the mode of continuous learning. In 2022 I decided to go on a programming courses, successfully passed the first step and right now I am on the second stage of studying, which includes learning JavaScript. I have no doubt that very soon I will get my first internship, after which my wish will come true.</p>
